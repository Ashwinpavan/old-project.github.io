            <p> A creative art business can take many shapes, but typically when one thinks of a creative business, they
                think of creation. Writing, music, design, fashion, and food are just the beginning of the countless
                creative business options out there. Artists, however, will likely want to focus on small art business
                ideas that make use of their talents in mediums such as photography, graphic design, calligraphy, and
                textile creation.</p>
